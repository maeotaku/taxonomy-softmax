This repo contains a new type of Softmax named Taxonomy Softmax (T-Softmax), which uses a hierarchy of classes to calculate the probability of a class. 
Code contains also the log loss associated with it. 

Code in another repo builds the hierarchy of classes. Datasets compatible with this can be found here:
